# resolution-reality-check

tiny, fun app that takes a New Year resolution and tells the user—honestly but kindly, whether it is:
Actually achievable
Optimistic but possible
Delusional (but we admire the confidence)
Think witty. Think self-aware. Think what every working professional secretly needs to hear on January 1st.
